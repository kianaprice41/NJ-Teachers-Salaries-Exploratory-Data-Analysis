## Summary
For one of my first data analysis projects, I decided to analyze teacher salaries in New Jersey based on a dataset I found on Kaggle. This topic is something that I was greatly interested in due to my mom being a teacher in New Jersey for over 25 years and my passion for fair pay amongst teachers all around the country. While I prepared the data for analysis, I had a few questions in mind:

### Questions
1. What was the average teacher salary in NJ in 2016?
2. What is the average teacher salary per county?
3. What is the highest earning county? Lowest?
4. How many years of experience do teachers have on average?
5. What is the average salary of teachers based on their years of experience? 

## Process
1. Understanding questions
2. Data Exploration
3. Data Cleaning - Removing blanks and unnecessary columns, filter by the official title
4. Create formulas - Determine work experience ranges (IF formula), determine most years worked (in order to create formula)
5. Create pivot tables - Average salary by county and work experience, avg salary by role category and work experience, average salary by work experience, average years of experience total by county, average salary overall
6. Create dashboard - charts for pivot tables

## Insights
**List average salary in NJ in 2016:** $74,138
**List average years of experience in NJ:** 12 years
**Lowest earning county:** Charter Schools (AVG $59,150) and Salem County (AVG $64,909)
